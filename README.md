### 📉 Business Problem  
Airlines face challenges in tracking passenger loads, optimizing routes, and understanding carrier performance. Without a consolidated dashboard, insights remain hidden in raw data.  

### 📝 Goal of the Dashboard  
To deliver an **interactive analytics tool** that:  
- Enables stakeholders to track **load factors, passenger volumes, and routes**  
- Identifies **top carriers and busiest routes**  
- Compares **weekend vs weekday efficiency**  
- Supports decisions on **scheduling and route optimization**  

### 📊 Walkthrough of Key Visuals  
- **Key KPIs (Top Panel)** → Total Passengers, Available Seats, Load Factor %  
- **Load Factor Trends (Line Chart)** → Year-wise and Carrier-wise analysis  
- **Top 10 Carriers (Bar Chart)** → Ranked by passenger preferences  
- **Top Routes (Bar Chart)** → From-to city combinations by number of flights  
- **Weekend vs Weekday Load Factor (Comparison Chart)** → Passenger efficiency trends  
- **Flights by Distance Group (Bar Chart)** → Categorized by flight distance ranges  

### 🎯 Business Use Case 
This project helps airlines:
- Track passenger trends and load factor efficiency
- Identify profitable carriers and routes
- Optimize scheduling based on weekday vs weekend trends
- Improve decision-making with data-driven insights
